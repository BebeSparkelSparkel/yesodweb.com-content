<simpara>monad-control is used in a few places within Yesod, most notably to ensure
proper exception handling within Persistent. It is a general purpose package to
extend standard functionality in monad transformers.</simpara>
<section id="monad-control_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>One of the powerful, and sometimes confusing, features in Haskell is monad
transformers. They allow you to take different pieces of functionality- such as
mutable state, error handling, or logging- and compose them together easily.
Though I swore I&#8217;d never write a monad tutorial, I&#8217;m going to employ a painful
analogy here: monads are like onions. (Monads are not like cakes.) By that, I
mean <emphasis>layers</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>We have the core monad- also known as the innermost or bottom monad. On top of
this core, we add layers, each adding a new feature and spreading
outward/upward. As a motivating example, let&#8217;s consider an <literal>ErrorT</literal> transformer
stacked on top of the IO monad:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">newtype ErrorT e m a = ErrorT { runErrorT :: m (Either e a) }
type MyStack = ErrorT MyError IO</programlisting>
<simpara>Now pay close attention here: ErrorT is just a simple newtype around an Either
wrapped in a monad. Getting rid of the newtype, we have:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type ErrorTUnwrapped e m a = m (Either e a)</programlisting>
<simpara>At some point, we&#8217;ll need to actually perform some IO inside our MyStack. If we
went with the unwrapped approach, it would be trivial, since there would be no
ErrorT constructor in the way. However, we need that newtype wrapper for a
whole bunch of type reasons I won&#8217;t go into here (this isn&#8217;t a monad
transformer tutorial after all). So the solution is the MonadTrans typeclass:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MonadTrans t where
    lift :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; t m a</programlisting>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll admit, the first time I saw that type signature, my response was stunned
confusion, and incredulity that it actually meant anything. But looking at an
instance helps a bit:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance (Error e) =&gt; MonadTrans (ErrorT e) where
    lift m = ErrorT $ do
        a &lt;- m
        return (Right a)</programlisting>
<simpara>All we&#8217;re doing is wrapping the inside of the IO with a Right value, and then
applying our newtype wrapper. This allows us to take an action that lives in
IO, and "lift" it to the outer/upper monad.</simpara>
<simpara>But now to the point at hand. This works very well for simple functions. For
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">sayHi :: IO ()
sayHi = putStrLn "Hello"

sayHiError :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
sayHiError = lift $ putStrLn "Hello"</programlisting>
<simpara>But let&#8217;s take something slightly more complicated, like a callback:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">withMyFile :: (Handle -&gt; IO a) -&gt; IO a
withMyFile = withFile "test.txt" WriteMode

sayHi :: Handle -&gt; IO ()
sayHi handle = hPutStrLn handle "Hi there"

useMyFile :: IO ()
useMyFile = withMyFile sayHi</programlisting>
<simpara>So far so good, right? Now let&#8217;s say that we need a version of sayHi that has
access to the Error monad:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">sayHiError :: Handle -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO ()
sayHiError handle = do
    lift $ hPutStrLn handle "Hi there, error!"
    throwError MyError</programlisting>
<simpara>We would like to write a function that combines withMyFile and sayHiError.
Unfortunately, GHC doesn&#8217;t like this very much:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileErrorBad :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileErrorBad = withMyFile sayHiError

    Couldn't match expected type `ErrorT MyError IO ()'
                with actual type `IO ()'</programlisting>
<simpara>Why does this happen, and how can we work around it?</simpara>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_intuition">
<title>Intuition</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s try and develop an external intuition of what&#8217;s happening here. The
<literal>ErrorT</literal> monad transformer adds extra functionality to the IO monad. We&#8217;ve
defined a way to "tack on" that extra functionality to normal IO actions: we
add that Right constructor and wrap it all in ErrorT. Wrapping in Right is our
way of saying "it went OK," there wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with this action.</simpara>
<simpara>Now this intuitively makes sense: since the IO monad doesn&#8217;t have the concept
of returning a MyError when something goes wrong, it will always succeed in the
lifting phase. (Note: This has <emphasis role="strong">nothing</emphasis> to do with runtime exceptions, don&#8217;t
even think about them.) What we have is a guaranteed one-directional
translation up the monad stack.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take another example: the Reader monad. A Reader has access to some extra
piece of data floating around. Whatever is running in the inner monad doesn&#8217;t
know about that extra piece of information. So how would you do a lift? You
just ignore that extra information. The Writer monad? Don&#8217;t write anything.
State? Don&#8217;t change anything. I&#8217;m seeing a pattern here.</simpara>
<simpara>But now let&#8217;s try and go in the opposite direction: I have something in a
Reader, and I&#8217;d like to run it in the base monad (e.g., IO). Well&#8230; that&#8217;s not
going to work, is it? I need that extra piece of information, I&#8217;m relying on
it, and it&#8217;s not there. There&#8217;s simply no way to go in the opposite direction
without providing that extra value.</simpara>
<simpara>Or is there? If you remember, we&#8217;d pointed out earlier that ErrorT is just a
simple wrapper around the inner monad. In other words, if I have <literal>errorValue
&#58;: ErrorT MyError IO MyValue</literal>, I can apply <literal>runErrorT</literal> and get a value of
type <literal>IO (Either MyError MyValue)</literal>. The looks quite a bit like bi-directional
translation, doesn&#8217;t it?</simpara>
<simpara>Well, not quite. We originally had an <literal>ErrorT MyError IO</literal> monad, with a value
of type <literal>MyValue</literal>. Now we have a monad of type <literal>IO</literal> with a value of type
<literal>Either MyError MyValue</literal>. So this process has in fact changed the value, while
the lifting process leaves it the same.</simpara>
<simpara>But still, with a little fancy footwork we can unwrap the ErrorT, do some
processing, and then wrap it back up again.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError1 :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileError1 =
    let unwrapped :: Handle -&gt; IO (Either MyError ())
        unwrapped handle = runErrorT $ sayHiError handle
        applied :: IO (Either MyError ())
        applied = withMyFile unwrapped
        rewrapped :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
        rewrapped = ErrorT applied
     in rewrapped</programlisting>
<simpara>This is the crucial point of this whole article, so look closely. We first
unwrap our monad. This means that, to the outside world, it&#8217;s now just a plain
old IO value. Internally, we&#8217;ve stored all the information from our ErrorT
transformer. Now that we have a plain old IO, we can easily pass it off to
withMyFile. withMyFile takes in the internal state and passes it back out
unchanged. Finally, we wrap everything back up into our original ErrorT.</simpara>
<simpara>This is the entire pattern of monad-control: we embed the extra features of our
monad transformer inside the value. Once in the value, the type system ignores
it and focuses on the inner monad. When we&#8217;re done playing around with that
inner monad, we can pull our state back out and reconstruct our original monad
stack.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_types">
<title>Types</title>
<simpara>I purposely started with the ErrorT transformer, as it is one of the simplest
for this inversion mechanism. Unfortunately, others are a bit more complicated.
Take for instance ReaderT. It is defined as <literal>newtype ReaderT r m a = ReaderT {
runReaderT &#58;: r -&gt; m a }</literal>. If we apply <literal>runReaderT</literal> to it, we get a
function that returns a monadic value. So we&#8217;re going to need some extra
machinery to deal with all that stuff. And this is when we leave Kansas behind.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few approaches to solving these problems. In the past, I
implemented a solution using type families in the neither package. Anders
Kaseorg implemented a much more straight-forward solution in monad-peel. And
for efficiency, in monad-control, Bas van Dijk uses CPS (continuation passing
style) and existential types.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The code taken from monad-control actually applies to version 0.2. 0.3
changed things just a bit, by making the state explicit with an associated
type, and generalizing <literal>MonadControlIO</literal> to <literal>MonadBaseControl</literal>, but the concepts
are still the same.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The first type we&#8217;re going to look at is:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type Run t = forall n o b. (Monad n, Monad o, Monad (t o)) =&gt; t n b -&gt; n (t o b)</programlisting>
<simpara>That&#8217;s incredibly dense, let&#8217;s talk it out. The only "input" datatype to this
thing is t, a monad transformer. A Run is a function that will then work with
<emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis> combination of types n, o and b (that&#8217;s what the forall means). n and o
are both monads, while b is a simple value contained by them.</simpara>
<simpara>The left hand side of the Run function, <literal>t n b</literal>, is our monad transformer
wrapped around the n monad and holding a b value. So for example, that could be
a <literal>MyTrans FirstMonad MyValue</literal>. It then returns a value with the transformer
"popped" inside, with a brand new monad at its core. In other words,
<literal>FirstMonad (MyTrans NewMonad MyValue)</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>That might sound pretty scary at first, but it actually isn&#8217;t as foreign as
you&#8217;d think: this is essentially what we did with ErrorT. We started with
ErrorT on the outside, wrapping around IO, and ended up with an IO by itself
containing an Either. Well guess what: another way to represent an Either is
<literal>ErrorT MyError Identity</literal>. So essentially, we pulled the IO to the outside and
plunked an Identity in its place. We&#8217;re doing the same thing in a Run: pulling
the FirstMonad outside and replacing it with a NewMonad.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Now might be a good time to get a beer.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Alright, now we&#8217;re getting somewhere. If we had access to one of those Run
functions, we could use it to peel off the ErrorT on our sayHiError function
and pass it to withMyFile. With the magic of undefined, we can play such a
game:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">errorRun :: Run (ErrorT MyError)
errorRun = undefined

useMyFileError2 :: IO (ErrorT MyError Identity ())
useMyFileError2 =
    let afterRun :: Handle -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError Identity ())
        afterRun handle = errorRun $ sayHiError handle
        applied :: IO (ErrorT MyError Identity ())
        applied = withMyFile afterRun
     in applied</programlisting>
<simpara>This looks eerily similar to our previous example. In fact, errorRun is acting
almost identically to runErrorT. However, we&#8217;re still left with two problems:
we don&#8217;t know where to get that errorRun value from, and we still need to
restructure the original ErrorT after we&#8217;re done.</simpara>
<section id="monad-control_monadtranscontrol">
<title>MonadTransControl</title>
<simpara>Obviously in the specific case we have before us, we could use our knowledge of
the ErrorT transformer to beat the types into submission and create our Run
function manually. But what we <emphasis>really</emphasis> want is a general solution for many
transformers. At this point, you know we need a typeclass.</simpara>
<simpara>So let&#8217;s review what we need: access to a Run function, and some way to
restructure our original transformer after the fact. And thus was born
MonadTransControl, with its single method liftControl:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MonadTrans t =&gt; MonadTransControl t where
    liftControl :: Monad m =&gt; (Run t -&gt; m a) -&gt; t m a</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at this closely. liftControl takes a function (the one we&#8217;ll be
writing). That function is provided with a Run function, and must return a
value in some monad (m). liftControl will then take the result of that function
and reinstate the original transformer on top of everything.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError3 :: Monad m =&gt; ErrorT MyError IO (ErrorT MyError m ())
useMyFileError3 =
    liftControl inside
  where
    inside :: Monad m =&gt; Run (ErrorT MyError) -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError m ())
    inside run = withMyFile $ helper run
    helper :: Monad m
           =&gt; Run (ErrorT MyError) -&gt; Handle -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError m ())
    helper run handle = run (sayHiError handle :: ErrorT MyError IO ())</programlisting>
<simpara>Close, but not exactly what I had in mind. What&#8217;s up with the double monads?
Well, let&#8217;s start at the end: sayHiError handle returns a value of type <literal>ErrorT
MyError IO ()</literal>. This we knew already, no surprises. What might be a little
surprising (it got me, at least) is the next two steps.</simpara>
<simpara>First we apply run to that value. Like we&#8217;d discussed before, the result is
that the IO inner monad is popped to the outside, to be replaced by some
arbitrary monad (represented by m here). So we end up with an IO (ErrorT
MyError m ()). Ok&#8230; We then get the same result after applying withMyFile. Not
surprising.</simpara>
<simpara>The last step took me a long time to understand correctly. Remember how we said
that we reconstruct the original transformer? Well, so we do: by plopping it
right on top of everything else we have. So our end result is the previous
type- <literal>IO (ErrorT MyError m ())</literal>- with a <literal>ErrorT MyError</literal> stuck on the front.</simpara>
<simpara>Well, that seems just about utterly worthless, right? Well, almost. But don&#8217;t
forget, that "m" can be any monad, including IO. If we treat it that way, we
get <literal>ErrorT MyError IO (ErrorT MyError IO ())</literal>. That looks a lot like <literal>m (m
a)</literal>, and we want just plain old <literal>m a</literal>. Fortunately, now we&#8217;re in luck:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError4 :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileError4 = join useMyFileError3</programlisting>
<simpara>And it turns out that this usage is so common, that Bas had mercy on us and
defined a helper function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">control :: (Monad m, Monad (t m), MonadTransControl t)
        =&gt; (Run t -&gt; m (t m a)) -&gt; t m a
control = join . liftControl</programlisting>
<simpara>So all we need to write is:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError5 :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileError5 =
    control inside
  where
    inside :: Monad m =&gt; Run (ErrorT MyError) -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError m ())
    inside run = withMyFile $ helper run
    helper :: Monad m
           =&gt; Run (ErrorT MyError) -&gt; Handle -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError m ())
    helper run handle = run (sayHiError handle :: ErrorT MyError IO ())</programlisting>
<simpara>And just to make it a little shorter:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError6 :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileError6 = control $ \run -&gt; withMyFile $ run . sayHiError</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_monadcontrolio">
<title>MonadControlIO</title>
<simpara>The MonadTrans class provides the lift method, which allows you to lift an
action one level in the stack. There is also the MonadIO class that provides
liftIO, which lifts an IO action as far in the stack as desired. We have the
same breakdown in monad-control. But first, we need a corrolary to Run:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type RunInBase m base = forall b. m b -&gt; base (m b)</programlisting>
<simpara>Instead of dealing with a transformer, we&#8217;re dealing with two monads. base is
the underlying monad, and m is a stack built on top of it. RunInBase is a
function that takes a value of the entire stack, pops out that base, and puts
in on the outside. Unlike in the Run type, we don&#8217;t replace it with an
arbitrary monad, but with the original one. To use some more concrete types:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">RunInBase (ErrorT MyError IO) IO = forall b. ErrorT MyError IO b -&gt; IO (ErrorT MyError IO b)</programlisting>
<simpara>This should look fairly similar to what we&#8217;ve been looking at so far, the only
difference is that we want to deal with a specific inner monad. Our
MonadControlIO class is really just an extension of MonadControlTrans using
this RunInBase.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class MonadIO m =&gt; MonadControlIO m where
    liftControlIO :: (RunInBase m IO -&gt; IO a) -&gt; m a</programlisting>
<simpara>Simply put, liftControlIO takes a function which receives a RunInBase. That
RunInBase can be used to strip down our monad to just an IO, and then
liftControlIO builds everything back up again. And like MonadControlTrans, it
comes with a helper function</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">controlIO :: MonadControlIO m =&gt; (RunInBase m IO -&gt; IO (m a)) -&gt; m a
controlIO = join . liftControlIO</programlisting>
<simpara>We can easily rewrite our previous example with it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">useMyFileError7 :: ErrorT MyError IO ()
useMyFileError7 = controlIO $ \run -&gt; withMyFile $ run . sayHiError</programlisting>
<simpara>And as an advantage, it easily scales to multiple transformers:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">sayHiCrazy :: Handle -&gt; ReaderT Int (StateT Double (ErrorT MyError IO)) ()
sayHiCrazy handle = liftIO $ hPutStrLn handle "Madness!"

useMyFileCrazy :: ReaderT Int (StateT Double (ErrorT MyError IO)) ()
useMyFileCrazy = controlIO $ \run -&gt; withMyFile $ run . sayHiCrazy</programlisting>
</section>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_real_life_examples">
<title>Real Life Examples</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s solve some real-life problems with this code. Probably the biggest
motivating use case is exception handling in a transformer stack. For example,
let&#8217;s say that we want to automatically run some cleanup code when an exception
is thrown. If this were normal IO code, we&#8217;d use:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">onException :: IO a -&gt; IO b -&gt; IO a</programlisting>
<simpara>But if we&#8217;re in the ErrorT monad, we can&#8217;t pass in either the action or the
cleanup. In comes controlIO to the rescue:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">onExceptionError :: ErrorT MyError IO a
                 -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO b
                 -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO a
onExceptionError action after = controlIO $ \run -&gt;
    run action `onException` run after</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say we need to allocate some memory to store a Double in. In the IO
monad, we could just use the alloca function. Once again, our solution is
simple:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">allocaError :: (Ptr Double -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO b)
            -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO b
allocaError f = controlIO $ \run -&gt; alloca $ run . f</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_lost_state">
<title>Lost State</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s rewind a bit to our onExceptionError. It uses onException under the
surface, which has a type signature: <literal>IO a -&gt; IO b -&gt; IO a</literal>. Let me ask
you something: what happened to the b in the output? Well, it was thoroughly
ignored. But that seems to cause us a bit of a problem. After all, we store our
transformer state information in the value of the inner monad. If we ignore it,
we&#8217;re essentially ignoring the monadic side effects as well!</simpara>
<simpara>And the answer is that, yes, this does happen with monad-control. Certain functions will drop some of the monadic side effects. This is put best by Bas, in the comments on the relevant functions:[quote]</simpara>
<blockquote>
<simpara>Note, any monadic side effects in m of the "release" computation will be discarded; it is run only for its side effects in IO.</simpara>
</blockquote>
<simpara>In practice, monad-control will usually be doing the right thing for you, but
you need to be aware that some side effects may disappear.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="monad-control_more_complicated_cases">
<title>More Complicated Cases</title>
<simpara>In order to make our tricks work so far, we&#8217;ve needed to have functions that
give us full access to play around with their values. Sometimes, this isn&#8217;t the
case. Take, for instance:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">addMVarFinalizer :: MVar a -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO ()</programlisting>
<simpara>In this case, we are required to have no value inside our finalizer function.
Intuitively, the first thing we should notice is that there will be no way to
capture our monadic side effects. So how do we get something like this to
compile? Well, we need to explicitly tell it to drop all of its state-holding
information:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">addMVarFinalizerError :: MVar a -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO () -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO ()
addMVarFinalizerError mvar f = controlIO $ \run -&gt;
    return $ liftIO $ addMVarFinalizer mvar (run f &gt;&gt; return ())</programlisting>
<simpara>Another case from the same module is:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">modifyMVar :: MVar a -&gt; (a -&gt; IO (a, b)) -&gt; IO b</programlisting>
<simpara>Here, we have a restriction on the return type in the second argument: it must
be a tuple of the value passed to that function and the final return value.
Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t see a way of writing a little wrapper around modifyMVar
to make it work for ErrorT. Instead, in this case, I copied the definition of
modifyMVar and modified it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">modifyMVar :: MVar a
           -&gt; (a -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO (a, b))
           -&gt; ErrorT MyError IO b
modifyMVar m io =
  Control.Exception.Control.mask $ \restore -&gt; do
    a      &lt;- liftIO $ takeMVar m
    (a',b) &lt;- restore (io a) `onExceptionError` liftIO (putMVar m a)
    liftIO $ putMVar m a'
    return b</programlisting>
