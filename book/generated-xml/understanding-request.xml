<title>Understanding a Request</title>
<simpara>You can often times get away with using Yesod for quite a while without needing
to understand its internal workings. However, such an understanding is often
times advantageous. This chapter will walk you through the request handling
process for a fairly typical Yesod application. Note that a fair amount of this
discussion involves code changes in Yesod 1.2. Most of the concepts are the
same in previous versions, though the data types involved were a bit messier.</simpara>
<simpara>Yesod&#8217;s usage of Template Haskell to bypass boilerplate code can make it
a bit difficult to understand this process sometimes. If beyond the information
in this chapter you wish to further analyze things, it can be useful to view
GHC&#8217;s generated code using -ddump-splices.</simpara>

<title>Handlers</title>
<simpara>When trying to understand Yesod request handling, we need to look at two
components: how a request is dispatched to the appropriate handler code, and
how handler functions are processed. We&#8217;ll start off with the latter, and
then circle back to understanding the dispatch process itself.</simpara>
<section id="understanding-request_layers">
<title>Layers</title>
<simpara>Yesod builds itself on top of WAI, which provides a protocol for web servers
(or, more generally, <emphasis>handlers</emphasis>) and applications to communicate with each
other. This is expressed through two datatypes: Request and Response. Then, an
Application is defined as type:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type Application = Request
                -&gt; (Response -&gt; IO ResponseReceived)
                -&gt; IO ResponseReceived</programlisting>
<simpara>A WAI handler will take an application and run it.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The structure of <literal>Application</literal> looks a bit complicated. It uses
continuation passing style to allow an application to safely acquire resources,
similar to the <literal>bracket</literal> function. See the WAI API documentation for more
details.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Request and Response are both very low-level, trying to represent the HTTP
protocol without too much embellishment. This keeps WAI as a generic tool, but
also leaves out a lot of the information we need in order to implement a web
framework. For example, WAI will provide us with the raw data for all request
headers. But Yesod needs to parse that to get cookie information, and then
parse the cookies in order to extract session information.</simpara>
<simpara>To deal with this dichotomy, Yesod introduces two new data types:
<literal>YesodRequest</literal> and <literal>YesodResponse</literal>. <literal>YesodRequest</literal> contains a WAI Request, and
also adds in such request information as cookies and session variables, and on
the response side can either be a standard WAI Response, or be a higher-level
representation of such a response including such things as updated session
information and extra response headers. To parallel WAI&#8217;s Application, we
have:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type YesodApp = YesodRequest -&gt; ResourceT IO YesodResponse</programlisting>
<note><simpara>Yesod uses <literal>ResourceT</literal> for exception safety, instead of continuation
passing style. This makes it much easier to write exception safe code in Yesod.</simpara></note>
<simpara>But as a Yesod user, you never really see <literal>YesodApp</literal>. There&#8217;s another layer
on top of that which you are used to dealing with: <literal>HandlerT</literal>. When you write
handler functions, you need to have access to three different things:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <literal>YesodRequest</literal> value for the current request.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Some basic environment information, like how to log messages or handle error conditions. This is provided by the datatype <literal>RunHandlerEnv</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A mutable variable to keep track of updateable information, such as the headers to be returned and the user session state. This is called <literal>GHState</literal>. (I know that&#8217;s not a great name, but it&#8217;s there for historical reasons.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>So when you&#8217;re writing a handler function, you&#8217;re essentially just
writing in a <literal>ReaderT</literal> transformer that has access to all of this information. The
<literal>runHandler</literal> function will turn a <literal>HandlerT</literal> into a <literal>YesodApp</literal>. <literal>yesodRunner</literal> takes this
a step further and converts all the way to a WAI <literal>Application</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="understanding-request_content">
<title>Content</title>
<simpara>Our example above, and many others you&#8217;ve already seen, give a handler
with a type of <literal>Handler Html</literal>. We&#8217;ve just described what the <literal>Handler</literal> means,
but how does Yesod know how to deal with <literal>Html</literal>? The answer lies in the
<literal>ToTypedContent</literal> typeclass. The relevants bit of code are:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Content = ContentBuilder !BBuilder.Builder !(Maybe Int) -- ^ The content and optional content length.
             | ContentSource !(Source (ResourceT IO) (Flush BBuilder.Builder))
             | ContentFile !FilePath !(Maybe FilePart)
             | ContentDontEvaluate !Content
data TypedContent = TypedContent !ContentType !Content

class ToContent a where
    toContent :: a -&gt; Content
class ToContent a =&gt; ToTypedContent a where
    toTypedContent :: a -&gt; TypedContent</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>Content</literal> datatype represents the different ways you can provide a response
body. The first three mirror WAI&#8217;s representation directly. The fourth
(<literal>ContentDontEvaluate</literal>) is used to indicate to Yesod whether response bodies
should be fully evaluated before being returned to users. The advantage to
fully evaluating is that we can provide meaningful error messages if an
exception is thrown from pure code. The downside is possibly increased time and
memory usage.</simpara>
<simpara>In any event, Yesod knows how to turn a <literal>Content</literal> into a response body. The
<literal>ToContent</literal> typeclass provides a way to allow many different datatypes to be
converted into response bodies. Many commonly used types are already instances
of <literal>ToContent</literal>, including strict and lazy <literal>ByteString</literal> and <literal>Text</literal>, and of course
<literal>Html</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>TypedContent</literal> adds an extra piece of information: the content type of the value.
As you might expect, there are <literal>ToTypedContent</literal> instances for a number of common
datatypes, including <literal>Html</literal>, aeson&#8217;s <literal>Value</literal> (for JSON), and <literal>Text</literal> (treated as plain text).</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance ToTypedContent J.Value where
    toTypedContent v = TypedContent typeJson (toContent v)
instance ToTypedContent Html where
    toTypedContent h = TypedContent typeHtml (toContent h)
instance ToTypedContent T.Text where
    toTypedContent t = TypedContent typePlain (toContent t)</programlisting>
<simpara>Putting this all together: a <literal>Handler</literal> is able to return any value which is an
instance of <literal>ToTypedContent</literal>, and Yesod will handle turning it into an
appropriate representation and setting the Content-Type response header.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="understanding-request_short_circuit_responses">
<title>Short-circuit responses</title>
<simpara>One other oddity is how short-circuiting works. For example, you can call
redirect in the middle of a handler function, and the rest of the function will
not be called. The mechanism we use is standard Haskell exceptions. Calling
<literal>redirect</literal> just throws an exception of type <literal>HandlerContents</literal>. The <literal>runHandler</literal>
function will catch any exceptions thrown and produce an appropriate response.
For <literal>HandlerContents</literal>, each constructor gives a clear action to perform, be it
redirecting or sending a file. For all other exception types, an error message
is displayed to the user.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="understanding-request_dispatch">
<title>Dispatch</title>
<simpara>Dispatch is the act of taking an incoming request and generating an appropriate
response. We have a few different constraints regarding how we want to handle
dispatch:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Dispatch based on path segments (or pieces).
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Optionally dispatch on request method.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Support subsites: packaged collections of functionality providing multiple routes under a specific URL prefix.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Support using WAI applications as subsites, while introducing as little
  runtime overhead to the process as possible. In particular, we want to avoid
  performing any unnecessary parsing to generate a YesodRequest if it
  won&#8217;t be used.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The lowest common denominator for this would be to simply use a WAI
<literal>Application</literal>. However, this doesn&#8217;t provide quite enough information: we
need access to the foundation datatype, the logger, and for subsites how a
subsite route is converted to a parent site route. To address this, we have two
helper data types- <literal>YesodRunnerEnv</literal> and <literal>YesodSubRunnerEnv</literal>- providing this extra
information for normal sites and subsites.</simpara>
<simpara>With those types, dispatch now becomes a relatively simple matter: give me an
environment and a request, and I&#8217;ll give you a response. This is
represented by the typeclasses <literal>YesodDispatch</literal> and <literal>YesodSubDispatch</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Yesod site =&gt; YesodDispatch site where
    yesodDispatch :: YesodRunnerEnv site -&gt; W.Application

class YesodSubDispatch sub m where
    yesodSubDispatch :: YesodSubRunnerEnv sub (HandlerSite m) m
                     -&gt; W.Application</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll see a bit later how <literal>YesodSubDispatch</literal> is used. Let&#8217;s first
understand how <literal>YesodDispatch</literal> comes into play.</simpara>
<section id="understanding-request_towaiapp_towaiappplain_and_warp">
<title>toWaiApp, toWaiAppPlain, and warp</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume for the moment that you have a datatype which is an instance
of <literal>YesodDispatch</literal>. You&#8217;ll want to now actually run this thing somehow. To
do this, we need to convert it into a WAI <literal>Application</literal> and pass it to some kind
of a WAI handler/server. To start this journey, we use <literal>toWaiAppPlain</literal>. It
performs any appwide initialization necessary. At the time of writing, this
means allocating a logger and setting up the session backend, but more
functionality may be added in the future. Using this data, we can now create a
<literal>YesodRunnerEnv</literal>. And when that value is passed to <literal>yesodDispatch</literal>, we get a WAI
<literal>Application</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;re almost done. The final remaining modification is path segment
cleanup. The <literal>Yesod</literal> typeclass includes a member function named <literal>cleanPath</literal> which
can be used to create canonical URLs. For example, the default implementation
would remove double slashes and redirect a user from <literal>/foo//bar</literal> to <literal>/foo/bar</literal>.
<literal>toWaiAppPlain</literal> adds in some pre-processing to the normal WAI request by
analyzing the requested path and performing cleanup/redirect as necessary.</simpara>
<simpara>At this point, we have a fully functional WAI <literal>Application</literal>. There are two other
helper functions included. <literal>toWaiApp</literal> wraps <literal>toWaiAppPlain</literal> and additionally
includes some commonly used WAI middlewares, including request logging and GZIP
compression. (Please see the Haddocks for an up-to-date list.) We finally have
the <literal>warp</literal> function which, as you might guess, runs your application with Warp.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There&#8217;s also the <literal>warpEnv</literal> function, which reads the port number
information from the <literal>PORT</literal> environment variable. This is used for interacting
with certain tools, including the Keter deployment manager and FP Haskell
Center.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="understanding-request_generated_code">
<title>Generated code</title>
<simpara>The last remaining black box is the Template Haskell generated code. This
generated code is responsible for handling some of the tedious, error-prone
pieces of your site. If you want to, you can write these all by hand instead.
We&#8217;ll demonstrate what that translation would look like, and in the
process elucidate how YesodDispatch and YesodSubDispatch work. Let&#8217;s
start with a fairly typical Yesod application.</simpara>

            , show $ rawPathInfo req
            ]

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 App</programlisting>
<simpara>For completeness we&#8217;ve provided a full listing, but let&#8217;s focus on
just the Template Haskell portion:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">mkYesod "App" [parseRoutes|
/only-get       OnlyGetR   GET
/any-method     AnyMethodR
/has-param/#Int HasParamR  GET
/my-subsite     MySubsiteR WaiSubsite getMySubsite
|]</programlisting>
<simpara>While this generates a few pieces of code, we only need to replicate three
components to make our site work. Let&#8217;s start with the simplest: the
<literal>Handler</literal> type synonym:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type Handler = HandlerT App IO</programlisting>
<simpara>Next is the type-safe URL and its rendering function. The rendering function is
allowed to generate both path segments and query string parameters. Standard
Yesod sites never generate query-string parameters, but it is technically
possible. And in the case of subsites, this often does happen. Notice how we
handle the qs parameter for the <literal>MySubsiteR</literal> case:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance RenderRoute App where
    data Route App = OnlyGetR
                   | AnyMethodR
                   | HasParamR Int
                   | MySubsiteR (Route WaiSubsite)
        deriving (Show, Read, Eq)

    renderRoute OnlyGetR = (["only-get"], [])
    renderRoute AnyMethodR = (["any-method"], [])
    renderRoute (HasParamR i) = (["has-param", toPathPiece i], [])
    renderRoute (MySubsiteR subRoute) =
        let (ps, qs) = renderRoute subRoute
         in ("my-subsite" : ps, qs)</programlisting>
<simpara>You can see that there&#8217;s a fairly simple mapping from the higher-level
route syntax and the RenderRoute instance. Each route becomes a constructor,
each URL parameter becomes an argument to its constructor, we embed a route for
the subsite, and use <literal>toPathPiece</literal> to render parameters to text.</simpara>
<simpara>The final component is the <literal>YesodDispatch</literal> instance. Let&#8217;s look at this in
a few pieces.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance YesodDispatch App where
    yesodDispatch env req =
        case pathInfo req of
            ["only-get"] -&gt;
                case requestMethod req of
                    "GET" -&gt; yesodRunner
                        getOnlyGetR
                        env
                        (Just OnlyGetR)
                        req
                    _ -&gt; yesodRunner
                        (badMethod &gt;&gt; return ())
                        env
                        (Just OnlyGetR)
                        req</programlisting>
<simpara>As described above, <literal>yesodDispatch</literal> is handed both an environment and a WAI
<literal>Request</literal> value. We can now perform dispatch based on the requested path, or in
WAI terms, the <literal>pathInfo</literal>. Referring back to our original high-level route
syntax, we can see that our first route is going to be the single piece
only-get, which we pattern match for.</simpara>
<simpara>Once that match has succeeded, we additionally pattern match on the request
method; if it&#8217;s <literal>GET</literal>, we use the handler function <literal>getOnlyGetR</literal>.
Otherwise, we want to return a 405 bad method response, and therefore use the
<literal>badMethod</literal> handler. At this point, we&#8217;ve come full circle to our original
handler discussion. You can see that we&#8217;re using <literal>yesodRunner</literal> to execute
our handler function. As a reminder, this will take our environment and WAI
<literal>Request</literal>, convert it to a <literal>YesodRequest</literal>, constructor a <literal>RunHandlerEnv</literal>, hand that
to the handler function, and then convert the resulting <literal>YesodResponse</literal> into a
WAI <literal>Response</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Wonderful; one down, three to go. The next one is even easier.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">            ["any-method"] -&gt;
                yesodRunner handleAnyMethodR env (Just AnyMethodR) req</programlisting>
<simpara>Unlike <literal>OnlyGetR</literal>, <literal>AnyMethodR</literal> will work for any request method, so we don&#8217;t
need to perform any further pattern matching.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">            ["has-param", t] | Just i &lt;- fromPathPiece t -&gt;
                case requestMethod req of
                    "GET" -&gt; yesodRunner
                        (getHasParamR i)
                        env
                        (Just $ HasParamR i)
                        req
                    _ -&gt; yesodRunner
                        (badMethod &gt;&gt; return ())
                        env
                        (Just $ HasParamR i)
                        req</programlisting>
<simpara>We add in one extra complication here: a dynamic parameter. While we used
<literal>toPathPiece</literal> to render to a textual value above, we now use <literal>fromPathPiece</literal> to
perform the parsing. Assuming the parse succeeds, we then follow a very similar
dispatch system as was used for <literal>OnlyGetR</literal>. The prime difference is that our
parameter needs to be passed to both the handler function and the route data
constructor.</simpara>
<simpara>Next we&#8217;ll look at the subsite, which is quite different.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">            ("my-subsite":rest) -&gt; yesodSubDispatch
                YesodSubRunnerEnv
                    { ysreGetSub = getMySubsite
                    , ysreParentRunner = yesodRunner
                    , ysreToParentRoute = MySubsiteR
                    , ysreParentEnv = env
                    }
                req { pathInfo = rest }</programlisting>
<simpara>Unlike the other pattern matches, here we just look to see if our pattern
prefix matches. Any route beginning with <literal>/my-subsite</literal> should be passed off to
the subsite for processing. This is where we finally get to use
<literal>yesodSubDispatch</literal>. This function closely mirrors <literal>yesodDispatch</literal>. We need to
construct a new environment to be passed to it. Let&#8217;s discuss the four
fields:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>ysreGetSub</literal> demonstrates how to get the subsite foundation type from the
  master site. We provide <literal>getMySubsite</literal>, which is the function we provided in
  the high-level route syntax.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>ysreParentRunner</literal> provides a means of running a handler function. It may seem
  a bit boring to just provide <literal>yesodRunner</literal>, but by having a separate parameter
  we allow the construction of deeply nested subsites, which will wrap and
  unwrap many layers of interleaving subsites. (This is a more advanced concept
  which we won&#8217;t be covering in this chapter.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>ysreToParentRoute</literal> will convert a route for the subsite into a route for the
  parent site. This is the purpose of the <literal>MySubsiteR</literal> constructor. This allows
  subsites to use functions such as <literal>getRouteToParent</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>ysreParentEnv</literal> simply passes on the initial environment, which contains a
  number of things the subsite may need (such as logger).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The other interesting thing is how we modify the <literal>pathInfo</literal>. This allows subsites
to <emphasis>continue dispatching</emphasis> from where the parent site left off. To demonstrate
how this works, see some screenshots of various requests in the following
figure.</simpara>
<figure><title>Path info in subsite</title>
<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/subsite-path-info.png"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>images/subsite-path-info.png</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>And finally, not all requests will be valid routes. For those cases, we just
want to respond with a 404 not found.</simpara>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<simpara>Yesod abstracts away quite a bit of the plumbing from you as a developer. Most
of this is boilerplate code that you&#8217;ll be happy to ignore. But it can be
empowering to understand exactly what&#8217;s going on under the surface. At
this point, you should hopefully be able- with help from the Haddocks- to write
a site without any of the autogenerated Template Haskell code. Not that
I&#8217;d recommend it; I think using the generated code is easier and safer.</simpara>
<simpara>One particular advantage of understanding this material is seeing where Yesod
sits in the world of WAI. This makes it easier to see how Yesod will interact
with WAI middleware, or how to include code from other WAI framework in a Yesod
application (or vice-versa!).</simpara>
