<title>http-conduit</title>
<simpara>Most of Yesod is about serving content over HTTP. But that&#8217;s only half the
story: someone has to receive it. And even when you&#8217;re writing a web app,
sometimes that someone will be you. If you want to consume content from other
services or interact with RESTful APIs, you&#8217;ll need to write client code. And
the recommended approach for that is http-conduit.</simpara>
<simpara>This chapter is not directly connected to Yesod, and will be generally useful
for anyone wanting to make HTTP requests.</simpara>

<title>Concepts</title>
<simpara>The simplest way to make a request in <literal>http-conduit</literal> is with the <literal>simpleHttp</literal>
function. This function takes a <literal>String</literal> giving a URL and returns a
<literal>ByteString</literal> with the contents of that URL. But under the surface, there are a
few more steps:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A new connection <literal>Manager</literal> is allocated.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The URL is parsed to a <literal>Request</literal>. If the URL is invalid, then an exception is thrown.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The HTTP request is made, following any redirects from the server.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If the response has a status code outside the 200-range, an exception is thrown.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response body is read into memory and returned.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>runResourceT</literal> is called, which will free up any resources (e.g., the open socket to the server).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If you want more control of what&#8217;s going on, then you can configure any of the
steps above (plus a few more) by explicitly creating a <literal>Request</literal> value,
allocating your <literal>Manager</literal> manually, and using the <literal>http</literal> and <literal>httpLbs</literal>
functions.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="http-conduit_request">
<title>Request</title>
<simpara>The easiest way to creating a <literal>Request</literal> is with the <literal>parseUrl</literal> function. This
function will return a value in any <literal>Failure</literal> monad, such as <literal>Maybe</literal> or <literal>IO</literal>.
The last of those is the most commonly used, and results in a runtime exception
whenever an invalid URL is provided. However, you can use a different monad if,
for example, you want to validate user input.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">import Network.HTTP.Conduit
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    args &lt;- getArgs
    case args of
        [urlString] -&gt;
            case parseUrl urlString of
                Nothing -&gt; putStrLn "Sorry, invalid URL"
                Just req -&gt; withManager $ \manager -&gt; do
                    res &lt;- httpLbs req manager
                    liftIO $ L.putStr $ responseBody res
        _ -&gt; putStrLn "Sorry, please provide exactly one URL"</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>Request</literal> type is abstract so that <literal>http-conduit</literal> can add new settings in
the future without breaking the API (see the Settings Type chapter for more
information). In order to make changes to individual records, you use record
notation. For example, a modification to our program that issues <literal>HEAD</literal>
requests and prints the response headers would be:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Network.HTTP.Conduit
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    args &lt;- getArgs
    case args of
        [urlString] -&gt;
            case parseUrl urlString of
                Nothing -&gt; putStrLn "Sorry, invalid URL"
                Just req -&gt; withManager $ \manager -&gt; do
                    let reqHead = req { method = "HEAD" }
                    res &lt;- http reqHead manager
                    liftIO $ do
                        print $ responseStatus res
                        mapM_ print $ responseHeaders res
        _ -&gt; putStrLn "Sorry, please provide example one URL"</programlisting>
<simpara>There are a number of different configuration settings in the API, some noteworthy ones are:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
proxy
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Allows you to pass the request through the given proxy server.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
redirectCount
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Indicate how many redirects to follow. Default is 10.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
checkStatus
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Check the status code of the return value. By default, gives an exception for any non-2XX response.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
requestBody
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The request body to be sent. Be sure to also update the <literal>method</literal>. For the common case of url-encoded data, you can use the <literal>urlEncodedBody</literal> function.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<section id="http-conduit_manager">
<title>Manager</title>
<simpara>The connection manager allows you to reuse connections. When making multiple
queries to a single server (e.g., accessing Amazon S3), this can be critical
for creating efficient code. A manager will keep track of multiple connections
to a given server (taking into account port and SSL as well), automatically
reaping unused connections as needed. When you make a request, <literal>http-conduit</literal>
first tries to check out an existing connection. When you&#8217;re finished with the
connection (if the server allows keep-alive), the connection is returned to the
manager. If anything goes wrong, the connection is closed.</simpara>
<simpara>To keep our code exception-safe, we use the <literal>ResourceT</literal> monad transformer. All
this means for you is that your code needs to be wrapped inside a call to
<literal>runResourceT</literal>, either implicitly or explicitly, and that code inside that
block will need to <literal>liftIO</literal> to perform normal IO actions.</simpara>
<simpara>There are two ways you can get ahold of a manager. <literal>newManager</literal> will return a
manager that will not be automatically closed (you can use <literal>closeManager</literal> to do
so manually), while <literal>withManager</literal> will start a new <literal>ResourceT</literal> block, allow you
to use the manager, and then automatically close the <literal>ResourceT</literal> when you&#8217;re
done. If you want to use a <literal>ResourceT</literal> for an entire application, and have no
need to close it, you should probably use <literal>newManager</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>One other thing to point out: you obviously don&#8217;t want to create a new manager
for each and every request; that would defeat the whole purpose. You should
create your <literal>Manager</literal> early and then share it.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="http-conduit_response">
<title>Response</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Response</literal> datatype has three pieces of information: the status code, the
response headers, and the response body. The first two are straight-forward;
let&#8217;s discuss the body.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Response</literal> type has a type variable to allow the response body to be of
multiple types. If you want to use <literal>http-conduit</literal>'s streaming interface, you
want this to be a <literal>Source</literal>. For the simple interface, it will be a lazy
<literal>ByteString</literal>. One thing to note is that, even though we use a lazy
<literal>ByteString</literal>, <emphasis>the entire response is held in memory</emphasis>. In other words, we
perform no lazy I/O in this package.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The <literal>conduit</literal> package does provide a lazy module which would allow you to
read this value in lazily, but like any lazy I/O, it&#8217;s a bit unsafe, and
definitely non-deterministic. If you need it though, you can use it.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="http-conduit_http_and_httplbs">
<title>http and httpLbs</title>
<simpara>So let&#8217;s tie it together. The <literal>http</literal> function gives you access to the streaming
interface (i.e., it returns a <literal>Response</literal> using a <literal>ResumableSource</literal>) while
<literal>httpLbs</literal> returns a lazy <literal>ByteString</literal>. Both of these return values in the
<literal>ResourceT</literal> transformer so that they can access the <literal>Manager</literal> and have
connections handled properly in the case of exceptions.</simpara>
<note><simpara>If you want to ignore the remainder of a large response body, you can
connect to the <literal>sinkNull</literal> sink. The underlying connection will automatically be
closed, preventing you from having to read a large response body over the
network.</simpara></note>
