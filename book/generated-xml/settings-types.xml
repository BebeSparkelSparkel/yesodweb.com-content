<title>Settings Types</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re writing a webserver. You want the server to take a port to
listen on, and an application to run. So you create the following function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">run :: Int -&gt; Application -&gt; IO ()</programlisting>
<simpara>But suddenly you realize that some people will want to customize their timeout
durations. So you modify your API:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">run :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Application -&gt; IO ()</programlisting>
<simpara>So, which <literal>Int</literal> is the timeout, and which is the port? Well, you could create
some type aliases, or comment your code. But there&#8217;s another problem creeping
into our code: this <literal>run</literal> function is getting unmanageable. Soon we&#8217;ll need to
take an extra parameter to indicate how exceptions should be handled, and then
another one to control which host to bind to, and so on.</simpara>
<simpara>A more extensible solution is to introduce a settings datatype:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Settings = Settings
    { settingsPort :: Int
    , settingsHost :: String
    , settingsTimeout :: Int
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>And this makes the calling code almost self-documenting:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">run Settings
    { settingsPort = 8080
    , settingsHost = "127.0.0.1"
    , settingsTimeout = 30
    } myApp</programlisting>
<simpara>Great, couldn&#8217;t be clearer, right? True, but what happens when you have 50
settings to your webserver. Do you really want to have to specify all of those
each time? Of course not. So instead, the webserver should provide a set of
defaults:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">defaultSettings = Settings 3000 "127.0.0.1" 30</programlisting>
<simpara>And now, instead of needing to write that long bit of code above, we can get
away with:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">run defaultSettings { settingsPort = 8080 } myApp -- (1)</programlisting>
<simpara>This is great, except for one minor hitch. Let&#8217;s say we now decide to add an
extra record to <literal>Settings</literal>. Any code out in the wild looking like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">run (Settings 8080 "127.0.0.1" 30) myApp -- (2)</programlisting>
<simpara>will be broken, since the <literal>Settings</literal> constructor now takes 4 arguments. The
proper thing to do would be to bump the major version number so that dependent
packages don&#8217;t get broken. But having to change major versions for every minor
setting you add is a nuisance. The solution? Don&#8217;t export the <literal>Settings</literal>
constructor:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">module MyServer
    ( Settings
    , settingsPort
    , settingsHost
    , settingsTimeout
    , run
    , defaultSettings
    ) where</programlisting>
<simpara>With this approach, no one can write code like (2), so you can freely add new
records without any fear of code breaking.</simpara>
<simpara>The one downside of this approach is that it&#8217;s not immediately obvious from the
Haddocks that you can actually change the settings via record syntax. That&#8217;s
the point of this chapter: to clarify what&#8217;s going on in the libraries that use
this technique.</simpara>
<simpara>I personally use this technique in a few places, feel free to have a look at
the Haddocks to see what I mean.</simpara>

<simpara>As a tangential issue, <literal>http-conduit</literal> and <literal>xml-conduit</literal> actually create
instances of the <literal>Default</literal> typeclass instead of declaring a brand new
identifier.  This means you can just type <literal>def</literal> instead of
<literal>defaultParserSettings</literal>.</simpara>
