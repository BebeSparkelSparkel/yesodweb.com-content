<title>Initializing data in the foundation datatype</title>
<simpara>This example is meant to demonstrate a relatively simple concept: performing
some initialization of data to be kept in the foundation datatype. There are
various reasons to do this, though the two most important are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Efficiency: by initializing data once, at process startup, you can avoid
  having to recompute the same value in each request.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Persistence: we want to store some information in a mutable location which
  will be persisted between individual requests. Often times, this is done via
  an external database, but it can also be done via an in-memory mutable
  variable.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><simpara>While mutable variables can be a convenient storage mechanism, remember
that they have some downsides. If your process dies, you lose your data. Also,
if you scale horizontally to more than one process, you&#8217;ll need some way to
synchronize the data between processes. We&#8217;ll punt on both of those issues for
this example, but the problems are real. This is one of the reasons Yesod puts
such a strong emphasis on using an external database for persistence.</simpara></note>
<simpara>To demonstrate, we&#8217;ll implement a very simple website. It will contain a single
route, and will serve content stored in a Markdown file. In addition to serving
that content, we&#8217;ll also display an old-school visitor counter indicating how
many visitors have been to the site.</simpara>
<section id="initializing-foundation-data_step_1_define_your_foundation">
<title>Step 1: define your foundation</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve identified two pieces of information to be initialized: the Markdown
content to be display on the homepage, and a mutable variable holding the
visitor count. Remember that our goal is to perform as much of the work in the
initialization phase as possible and thereby avoid performing the same work in
the handlers themselves. Therefore, we want to preprocess the Markdown content
into HTML. As for the visitor count, a simple <literal>IORef</literal> should be sufficient. So
our foundation data type is:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data App = App
    { homepageContent :: Html
    , visitorCount    :: IORef Int
    }</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="initializing-foundation-data_step_2_use_the_foundation">
<title>Step 2: use the foundation</title>
<simpara>For this trivial example, we only have one route: the homepage. All we need to do is:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Increment the visitor count.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Get the new visitor count.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Display the Markdown content together with the visitor count.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>One trick we&#8217;ll use to make the code a bit shorter is to utilize record
wildcard syntax: <literal>App {..}</literal>. This is convenient when we want to deal with a
number of different fields in a datatype.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">getHomeR :: Handler Html
getHomeR = do
    App {..} &lt;- getYesod
    currentCount &lt;- liftIO $ atomicModifyIORef visitorCount
        $ \i -&gt; (i + 1, i + 1)
    defaultLayout $ do
        setTitle "Homepage"
        [whamlet|
            &lt;article&gt;#{homepageContent}
            &lt;p&gt;You are visitor number: #{currentCount}.
        |]</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="initializing-foundation-data_step_3_create_the_foundation_value">
<title>Step 3: create the foundation value</title>
<simpara>When we initialize our application, we&#8217;ll now need to provide values for the
two fields we described above. This is normal <literal>IO</literal> code, and can perform any
arbitrary actions needed. In our case, we need to:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Read the Markdown from the file.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Convert that Markdown to HTML.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Create the visitor counter variable.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>The code ends up being just as simple as those steps imply:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">go :: IO ()
go = do
    rawMarkdown &lt;- TLIO.readFile "homepage.md"
    countRef &lt;- newIORef 0
    warp 3000 App
        { homepageContent = markdown def rawMarkdown
        , visitorCount    = countRef
        }</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="initializing-foundation-data_conclusion">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<simpara>There&#8217;s no rocket science involved in this example, just very straightforward
programming. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate the commonly used
best practice for achieving these often needed objectives. In your own
applications, the initialization steps will likely be much more complicated:
setting up database connection pools, starting background jobs to batch process
large data, or anything else. After reading this chapter, you should now have a
good idea of where to place your application-specific initialization code.</simpara>
