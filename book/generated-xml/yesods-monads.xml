<title>Yesod&#8217;s Monads</title>
<simpara>As you&#8217;ve read through this book, there have been a number of monads which have
appeared: <literal>Handler</literal>, <literal>Widget</literal> and <literal>YesodDB</literal> (for Persistent). As with most
monads, each one provides some specific functionality: <literal>Handler</literal> gives access
to the request and allows you to send responses, a <literal>Widget</literal> contains HTML, CSS,
and Javascript, and <literal>YesodDB</literal> lets you make database queries. In
Model-View-Controller (MVC) terms, we could consider <literal>YesodDB</literal> to be the model,
<literal>Widget</literal> to be the view, and <literal>Handler</literal> to be the controller.</simpara>
<simpara>So far, we&#8217;ve presented some very straight-forward ways to use these monads:
your main handler will run in <literal>Handler</literal>, using <literal>runDB</literal> to execute a <literal>YesodDB</literal>
query, and <literal>defaultLayout</literal> to return a <literal>Widget</literal>, which in turn was created by
calls to <literal>toWidget</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>However, if we have a deeper understanding of these types, we can achieve some
fancier results.</simpara>

<title>Monad Transformers</title>

</blockquote>
<simpara>Before we get into the heart of Yesod&#8217;s monads, we need to understand a bit
about monad transformers. (If you already know all about monad transformers,
you can likely skip this section.) Different monads provide different
functionality: <literal>Reader</literal> allows read-only access to some piece of data
throughout a computation, <literal>Error</literal> allows you to short-circuit computations, and
so on.</simpara>
<simpara>Often times, however, you would like to be able to combine a few of these
features together. After all, why not have a computation with read-only access
to some settings variable, that could error out at any time? One approach to
this would be to write a new monad like <literal>ReaderError</literal>, but this has the obvious
downside of exponential complexity: you&#8217;ll need to write a new monad for every
single possible combination.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead, we have monad transformers. In addition to <literal>Reader</literal>, we have
<literal>ReaderT</literal>, which adds reader functionality to any other monad. So we could
represent our <literal>ReaderError</literal> as (conceptually):</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type ReaderError = ReaderT Error</programlisting>
<simpara>In order to access our settings variable, we can use the <literal>ask</literal> function. But
what about short-circuiting a computation? We&#8217;d like to use <literal>throwError</literal>, but
that won&#8217;t exactly work. Instead, we need to <literal>lift</literal> our call into the next
monad up. In other words:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">throwError :: errValue -&gt; Error
lift . throwError :: errValue -&gt; ReaderT Error</programlisting>
<simpara>There are a few things you should pick up here:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A transformer can be used to add functionality to an existing monad.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A transformer must always wrap around an existing monad.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The functionality available in a wrapped monad will be dependent not only on
  the monad transformer, but also on the inner monad that is being wrapped.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A great example of that last point is the <literal>IO</literal> monad. No matter how many layers
of transformers you have around an <literal>IO</literal>, there&#8217;s still an <literal>IO</literal> at the core,
meaning you can perform I/O in any of these monad transformer stacks. You&#8217;ll
often see code that looks like <literal>liftIO $ putStrLn "Hello There!"</literal>.</simpara>

<title>The Three Transformers</title>
<note><simpara>In previous versions of Yesod, <literal>Handler</literal> and <literal>Widget</literal> were far more
magical and scary. Since version 1.2, things are much simplified. So if you
remember reading some scary stuff about fake transformers and subsite
parameters, rest assured: you haven&#8217;t gone crazy, things have actually changed
a bit. The story with persistent is likewise much simpler.</simpara></note>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve already discussed two of our transformers previously: <literal>Handler</literal> and
<literal>Widget</literal>. Remember that these are each application-specific synonyms for the
more generic <literal>HandlerT</literal> and <literal>WidgetT</literal>. Each of those transformers takes two
type parameters: your foundation data type, and a base monad. The most commonly
used base monad is <literal>IO</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In persistent, we have a typeclass called <literal>PersistStore</literal>. This typeclass
defines all of the primitive operations you can perform on a database, like
<literal>get</literal>. There are instances of this typeclass for each database backend
supported by persistent. For example, for SQL databases, there is a monad
transformer <literal>SqlPersistT</literal>.  This means that you can run a SQL database with any
underlying monad. The takeaway here is that we can layer our Persistent
transformer on top of <literal>Handler</literal> or <literal>Widget</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There actually are two requirements for the base monad of <literal>SqlPersistT</literal>:
it must be an instance of <literal>MonadResource</literal> (to allow proper exception handling),
and <literal>MonadLogger</literal> (to allow logging of SQL queries). Fortunately, both
<literal>Handler</literal> and <literal>Widget</literal> fulfill both of these requirements.</simpara></note>
<simpara>In order to make it simpler to refer to the relevant Persistent transformer,
the yesod-persistent package defines the <literal>YesodPersistBackend</literal> associated type.
For example, if I have a site called <literal>MyApp</literal> and it uses SQL, I would define
something like <literal>type instance YesodPersistBackend MyApp = SqlPersistT</literal>. And for
more convenience, we have a type synonym called <literal>YesodDB</literal> which is defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type YesodDB site = YesodPersistBackend site (HandlerT site IO)</programlisting>
<simpara>Our database actions will then have types that look like <literal>YesodDB MyApp
SomeResult</literal>. In order to run these, we can use the standard Persistent unwrap
functions (like <literal>runSqlPool</literal>) to run the action and get back a normal
<literal>Handler</literal>. To automate this, we provide the <literal>runDB</literal> function. Putting it all
together, we can now run database actions inside our handlers.</simpara>
<simpara>Most of the time in Yesod code, and especially thus far in this book, widgets
have been treated as actionless containers that simply combine together HTML,
CSS and Javascript. But in reality, a <literal>Widget</literal> can do anything that a <literal>Handler</literal>
can do, by using the <literal>handlerToWidget</literal> function. So for example, you can run
database queries inside a <literal>Widget</literal> by using something like <literal>handlerToWidget .
runDB</literal>.</simpara>

<section id="yesods-monads_example_database_driven_navbar">
<title>Example: Database-driven navbar</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s put some of this new knowledge into action. We want to create a <literal>Widget</literal>
that generates its output based on the contents of the database. Previously,
our approach would have been to load up the data in a <literal>Handler</literal>, and then pass
that data into a <literal>Widget</literal>. Now, we&#8217;ll do the loading of data in the <literal>Widget</literal>
itself. This is a boon for modularity, as this <literal>Widget</literal> can be used in any
<literal>Handler</literal> we want, without any need to pass in the database contents.</simpara>

<simpara>Notice that in this case, we didn&#8217;t even have to call <literal>handlerToWidget</literal>. The
reason is that a number of the functions included in Yesod automatically work
for both <literal>Handler</literal> and <literal>Widget</literal>, by means of the <literal>MonadHandler</literal> typeclass. In
fact, <literal>MonadHandler</literal> will allow these functions to be "autolifted" through
many common monad transformers.</simpara>
<simpara>But if you want to, you can wrap up the call to <literal>runInputGet</literal> above using
<literal>handlerToWidget</literal>, and everything will work the same.</simpara>

<section id="yesods-monads_performance_and_error_messages">
<title>Performance and error messages</title>
<note><simpara>You can consider this section extra credit. It gets into some of the
design motivation behind Yesod, which isn&#8217;t necessary for usage of Yesod.</simpara></note>
<simpara>At this point, you may be just a bit confused. As I mentioned above, the
<literal>Widget</literal> synonym uses <literal>IO</literal> as its base monad, not <literal>Handler</literal>. So how can
<literal>Widget</literal> perform <literal>Handler</literal> actions? And why <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> just make <literal>Widget</literal> a
transformer on top of <literal>Handler</literal>, and then use <literal>lift</literal> instead of this special
<literal>handlerToWidget</literal>? And finally, I mentioned that <literal>Widget</literal> and <literal>Handler</literal> were
both instances of <literal>MonadResource</literal>. If you&#8217;re familiar with <literal>MonadResource</literal>, you
may be wondering why <literal>ResourceT</literal> doesn&#8217;t appear in the monad transformer stack.</simpara>
<simpara>The fact of the matter is, there&#8217;s a much simpler (in terms of implementation)
approach we could take for all of these monad transformers. <literal>Handler</literal> could be
a transformer on top of <literal>ResourceT IO</literal> instead of just <literal>IO</literal>, which would be a
bit more accurate. And <literal>Widget</literal> could be layered on top of <literal>Handler</literal>. The end
result would look something like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type Handler = HandlerT App (ResourceT IO)
type Widget  = WidgetT  App (HandlerT App (ResourceT IO))</programlisting>
<simpara>Doesn&#8217;t look too bad, especially since you mostly deal with the more friendly
type synonyms instead of directly with the transformer types. The problem is
that any time those underlying transformers leak out, these larger type
signatures can be incredibly confusing. And the most common time for them to
leak out is in error messages, when you&#8217;re probably already pretty confused!
(Another time is when working on subsites, which happens to be confusing too.)</simpara>
<simpara>One other concern is that each monad transformer layer does add some amount of
a performance penalty. This will probably be negligible compared to the I/O
you&#8217;ll be performing, but the overhead is there.</simpara>
<simpara>So instead of having properly layered transformers, we flatten out each of
<literal>HandlerT</literal> and <literal>WidgetT</literal> into a one-level transformer. Here&#8217;s a high-level
overview of the approach we use:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>HandlerT</literal> is really just a <literal>ReaderT</literal> monad. (We give it a different name to
  make error messages clearer.) This is a reader for the <literal>HandlerData</literal> type,
  which contains request information and some other immutable contents.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In addition, <literal>HandlerData</literal> holds an <literal>IORef</literal> to a <literal>GHState</literal> (badly named for
  historical reasons), which holds some data which can be mutated during the
  course of a handler (e.g., session variables). The reason we use an <literal>IORef</literal>
  instead of a <literal>StateT</literal> kind of approach is that <literal>IORef</literal> will maintain the
  mutated state even if a runtime exception is thrown.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <literal>ResourceT</literal> monad transformer is essentially a <literal>ReaderT</literal> holding onto an
  <literal>IORef</literal>. This <literal>IORef</literal> contains the information on all cleanup actions that
  must be performed. (This is called <literal>InternalState</literal>.) Instead of having a
  separate transformer layer to hold onto that reference, we hold onto the
  reference ourself in <literal>HandlerData</literal>. (And yes, the reson for an <literal>IORef</literal> here
  is also for runtime exceptions.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <literal>WidgetT</literal> is essentially just a <literal>WriterT</literal> on top of everything that a
  <literal>HandlerT</literal> does. But since <literal>HandlerT</literal> is just a <literal>ReaderT</literal>, we can easily
  compress the two aspects into a single transformer, which looks something
  like <literal>newtype WidgetT site m a = WidgetT (HandlerData &#8594; m (a, WidgetData))</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If you want to understand this more, please have a look at the definitions of
<literal>HandlerT</literal> and <literal>WidgetT</literal> in <literal>Yesod.Core.Types</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="yesods-monads_adding_a_new_monad_transformer">
<title>Adding a new monad transformer</title>
<simpara>At times, you&#8217;ll want to add your own monad transformer in part of your
application. As a motivating example, let&#8217;s consider the
<ulink url="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monadcryptorandom">monadcryptorandom</ulink>
package from Hackage, which defines both a <literal>MonadCRandom</literal> typeclass for monads
which allow generating cryptographically-secure random values, and <literal>CRandT</literal> as
a concrete instance of that typeclass. You would like to write some code that
generates a random bytestring, e.g.:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">import Control.Monad.CryptoRandom
import Data.ByteString.Base16 (encode)
import Data.Text.Encoding (decodeUtf8)

getHomeR = do
    randomBS &lt;- getBytes 128
    defaultLayout
        [whamlet|
            &lt;p&gt;Here's some random data: #{decodeUtf8 $ encode randomBS}
        |]</programlisting>
<simpara>However, this results in an error message along the lines of:</simpara>
    No instance for (MonadCRandom e0 (HandlerT App IO))
      arising from a use of ‘getBytes’
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: randomBS &lt;- getBytes 128</programlisting>
<simpara>How do we get such an instance? One approach is to simply use the <literal>CRandT</literal> monad transformer when we call <literal>getBytes</literal>. A complete example of doing so would be:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, QuasiQuotes, TemplateHaskell, TypeFamilies #-}
import Yesod
import Crypto.Random (SystemRandom, newGenIO)
import Control.Monad.CryptoRandom

getHomeR = do
    gen &lt;- liftIO newGenIO
    eres &lt;- evalCRandT (getBytes 16) (gen :: SystemRandom)
    randomBS &lt;-
        case eres of
            Left e -&gt; error $ show (e :: GenError)
            Right gen -&gt; return gen
    defaultLayout
        [whamlet|

        |]

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 App</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that what we&#8217;re doing is layering the <literal>CRandT</literal> transformer on <emphasis role="strong">top</emphasis> of the
<literal>HandlerT</literal> transformer. It does not work to do things the other way around:
Yesod itself would ultimately have to unwrap the <literal>CRandT</literal> transformer, and it
has no knowledge of how to do so. Notice that this is the same approach we take
with Persistent: its transformer goes on top of <literal>HandlerT</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>But there are two downsides to this approach:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
It requires you to jump into this alternate monad each time you want to work with random values.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
It&#8217;s inefficient: you need to create a new random seed each time you enter this other monad.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>The second point could be worked around by storing the random seed in the
foundation datatype, in a mutable reference like an <literal>IORef</literal>, and then
atomically sampling it each time we enter the <literal>CRandT</literal> transformer. But we can
even go a step further, and use this trick to make our <literal>Handler</literal> monad itself
an instance of <literal>MonadCRandom</literal>! Let&#8217;s look at the code, which is in fact a bit
involved:</simpara>

<simpara>This really comes down to a few different concepts:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
We modify the <literal>App</literal> datatype to have a field for an <literal>IORef SystemRandom</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Similarly, we modify the <literal>main</literal> function to generate an <literal>IORef SystemRandom</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Our <literal>getHomeR</literal> function became a lot simpler: we can now simply call <literal>getBytes</literal> without playing with transformers.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
However, we <emphasis role="strong">have</emphasis> gained some complexity in needing a <literal>MonadCRandom</literal> instance. Since this is a book on Yesod, and not on <literal>monadcryptorandom</literal>, I&#8217;m not going to go into details on this instance, but I encourage you to inspect it, and if you&#8217;re interested, compare it to the instance for <literal>CRandT</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Hopefully, this helps get across an important point: the power of the
<literal>HandlerT</literal> transformer. By just providing you with a readable environment,
you&#8217;re able to recreate a <literal>StateT</literal> transformer by relying on mutable
references. In fact, if you rely on the underlying <literal>IO</literal> monad for runtime
exceptions, you can implement most cases of <literal>ReaderT</literal>, <literal>WriterT</literal>, <literal>StateT</literal>, and
<literal>ErrorT</literal> with this abstraction.</simpara>

<simpara>If you completely ignore this chapter, you&#8217;ll still be able to use Yesod to
great benefit. The advantage of understanding how Yesod&#8217;s monads interact is to
be able to produce cleaner, more modular code. Being able to perform arbitrary
actions in a <literal>Widget</literal> can be a powerful tool, and understanding how Persistent
and your <literal>Handler</literal> code interact can help you make more informed design
decisions in your app.</simpara>
