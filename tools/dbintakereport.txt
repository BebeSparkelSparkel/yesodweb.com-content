** Notes from Dan:
==================

Tools
* Please update the title to match the PDB. [DONE AT INTAKE. --TOOLS]
* Please add the boilerplate Preface. [DONE AT INTAKE. --TOOLS]
* please convert straight quotes to curlies. [DONE AT INTAKE. --TOOLS]


Production
* This will be released under a Creative Commons license. I'll write to Cali to get direction on the language that should
appear on the copyright page. --Dan
* Note from the editor: This should just need a proofread, not a full copyedit. The author works for a documentation
company and this has had many readers.
* Tools noticed that the author used figure elements to wrap some programlistings and changed those to example
elements.
* I noticed lowercase "web" and a lack of serial commas. Probably not big deals, given how nice the writing is in general.
Please watch for typos though.
* There's a bit of code on page 9 inside a Note. It doesn't run off the page, but looks like it should be broken to align with
the borders of the note instead of the page.


Illustrations
* Draft figures posted here: /work/eans/9781449316976/figs/incoming/
==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Jess
