Last year I [spoke at PolyConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfINRj5OzGw)
about client/server Haskell webapps, and especially on GHCJS. [This year's
PolyConf](http://polyconf.com/) has just opened up a [Call for
Proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eYd1bNcaG3cJj-_T5WGzPGkdiIHIt7OtEpjvTE-_6dY/viewform?fbzx=-1931623602763285706).

I really enjoyed my time at the conference last year: it's a great place to
meet and interact with people doing cool things in other languages, and can be
a great source of inspiration for ways we can do things better. Also, as [I've
mentioned
recently](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/yesodweb/dbUsQuB656w/g8AfoKnWZqIJ), I
think it's a great thing for us Haskellers to put out content accessible by the
non-Haskell world, and a conference like this is a perfect way to do so.

If you have a topic that you think polyglot programmers would be interested in,
please take the time to submit a proposal for the conference.
