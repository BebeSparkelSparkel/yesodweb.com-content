I've heard that [my previous blog
post](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2014/09/misassigned-credit-for-conduit) has
caused a bit of confusion, as sarcasm doesn't really come across in text very
well. So let me elaborate (and of course, in the process, kill the joke):

Some years back, Erik found a case that was quite difficult to implement using
enumerator. After we cracked our heads on it for long enough, some of us (I
don't actually remember who was involved) decided to work on a new streaming
library. That library ended up being called conduit (thanks to Yitz for the
naming idea). It turns out that most people are unaware of that history, so
when at ICFP, I casually mentioned that Erik was the cause of conduit coming
into existence, some people were surprised. Erik **jokingly** chastised me for
not giving him enough credit. In response, I decided to write an over-the-top
post giving Erik **all** credit for conduit. I say over the top, since I made
it seem like there was some large amount of blame being heaped on as well.

So to be completely clear:

* Erik and I are good friends, and this was just a bit of an inside joke turned public.
* No one has said *anything* offensive to me at all about conduit. There are obviously differing opinions out there about the best library for a job, but there's nothing offensive about it, just healthy discussion around a complicated topic. My purpose in making a big deal about it was *not* to express frustration at anyone attacking me, but rather to just play up the joke a bit more.

My apologies to anyone who was confused, upset, or worried by the previous
post, it was completely unintentional.
