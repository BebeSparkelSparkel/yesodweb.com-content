When I was at ICFP last week, it became clear that I had made a huge mistake in
the past three years. A few of us were talking, including Erik de Castro Lopo,
and when I mentioned that he was the original inspiration for creating the
conduit package, everyone else was surprised. So firstly: Erik, I apologize for
not making it clear that you initially kicked off development by finding some
fun corner cases in enumerator that were difficult to debug.

So to rectify that, I think it's only fair that I write the following:

* conduit is entirely Erik's fault.
* If you love conduit, write Erik a thank you email.
* More importantly, if you hate conduit, there's no need to complain to me anymore. Erik presumably will be quite happy to receive all such further communications.
* In other words, it's not my company, I just work here.

Thanks Erik :)
