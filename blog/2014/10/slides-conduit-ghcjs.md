I'm currently sitting in a hotel room in Poznan, Poland, getting ready to
attend the second day of PolyConf. In the past two days, I've already had quite
some fun. Wednesday- thanks to Matthias Fischmann and Adam Drake- I spoke to
the Berlin Haskell users group about conduit. I had no idea that there were
this many Haskellers in Berlin, and it was awesome to meet all of you.
Yesterday I spoke about Haskell on the client side at PolyConf, mostly talking
about how awesome GHCJS is (after Luite indoctrinated me at ICFP).

For those interested, the slides are now available online at:

* [Conduit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RBefOCZ7AKOo4f1yiF4mtKPAT3l5vY9ky2SR02O4Vvg&authuser=0)
* [Server/Client Hybrid Webapps in Haskell](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RBefOCZ7AKOo4f1yiF4mtKPAT3l5vY9ky2SR02O4Vvg&authuser=0)

I've also learnt quite a number of cool client side tricks at PolyConf,
hopefully we'll get to take advantage of some of them in Yesod in the near
future :).
